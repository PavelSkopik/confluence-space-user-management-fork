                There are currently no groups that match both of the following criteria:
                <ul>
                  <li>Group has rights to view space '${key}' <b>and</b></li>
                  <li>Group has name matching the group name pattern defined for this space in the plugin configuration:
                      '${action.spacePattern}'.</li>
                </ul>

                If you feel that groups should be displayed here or are not sure what to do, then check with the system
                administrator to verify that the group name pattern, group name prefix, and group name suffix are
                correct.

                If you have never used this interface before, you probably have nothing to worry about and can go along
                your merry way adding groups and managing users in them.
