   Initally I developed this plugin as part of Atlassian Codegeist 2006. I wanted 
to add (missing) functionality in Confluence Wiki which would help Wiki 
Space Administrators in managing users associated to their spaces. Very happy to know
that many users find this plugin useful!
   In June 2007 nice folks from Duke University (Gary & Ren) wanted to have something
very similar to this but with more features. That's where v2.0 of this plugin got evolved.
Thanks to them for putting great effort. We are improving and getting better. Stay tuned!

   This plugin arose from a need we had to reduce the pain and suffering of our support
team who had been managing groups for space administrators. When we saw the code in v1.1
of Rajendra's plugin, we knew it would be a better idea to extend it rather than create
our own. We are very thankful to Rajendra for letting us join the team. Thanks also to
Ren to did all the cool UI stuff in the transition to v2 of the plugin.
   Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
